All that was 6 years ago, but Greece has not managed to turn the corner since then, when every other Eurozone country that took a bailout has. The primary reason for this is that Greece was the first country to ask for help, and the Eurozone was totally unprepared for it on all levels. The bailout was badly conceived, focusing too much on the budget balance and not enough on fixing Greece’s uniquely dysfunctional state apparatus. In a normal recession, government spending can offset the negative effects of private demand contracting, but in this case, the budgetary austerity drove Greece into a vicious spiral. The economy contracted by 25% between 2010 and 2014, fatally weakening Greece’s ability ever to repay its debts."
